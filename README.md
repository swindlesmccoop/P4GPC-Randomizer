# Development moved to [CBPS Git](https://git.cbps.xyz/swindlesmccoop)

## General Info
This is a work in progress. Please submit detailed issues in the `Issues` tab. Do not spam the `#p4g-help` channel on the Discord!

This uses bash instead of C# to randomize the files in P4G for Windows because I had no idea what I'm doing with code that someone else wrote in a langauge I barely know, plus scripting is more fun and efficient than using a GUI.

Excuse the sloppiness/repetitiveness of the script(s). If it ain't broke don't fix it, you know? (If you want to commit though I would probably push anything that works and takes up less space).
