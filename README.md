# P4GPC-Randomizer
This is a work in progress. It is not done yet. Please do not submit any issues until I publish an actual release.

This uses bash instead of C# to randomize the files in P4G for Windows because I had no idea what I'm doing with code that someone else wrote in a langauge I barely know, plus scripting is more fun and efficient than using a GUI.

Excuse the sloppiness/repetitiveness of the script. If it ain't broke don't fix it, you know? (If you want to commit though I would probably push anything that works and takes up less space).

## Instructions
Use Preapp File to dump data_e somewhere.

Run stable.sh in the folder that you just extracted all the files into. Don't use the randomizer if you don't know how to do this - you don't deserve to be using a computer if you can't figure it out for yourself. It will most likely run best under Linux, so go install Ubuntu or Mint or something if you haven't already and mount your Windows install and run the script in there.

Put the folder that you randomized the files of into your mods directory. If you don't know how to load mods on P4G PC, you don't deserve to be modding the game.
