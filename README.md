# P4GPC-Randomizer
This is a work in progress. It is not done yet. Please do not submit any issues until I publish an actual release.

This uses bash instead of C# to randomize the files in P4G for Windows because I had no idea what I'm doing with code that someone else wrote in a langauge I barely know.

Excuse the sloppiness/repetitiveness of the script. If it ain't broke don't fix it, you know? (If you want to commit though I would probably push anything that works and takes up less space).
