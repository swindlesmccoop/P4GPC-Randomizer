# P4GPC-Randomizer
This uses bash instead of C# to randomize the files in P4G for Windows because I had no idea what I'm doing with code that someone else wrote in a langauge I barely know.

Excuse the sloppiness of the script. If it ain't broke don't fix it, you know? (If you want to commit though I would probably push anything that works and takes up less space).
