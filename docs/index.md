### Why this exists
Randomizers are fun, and there's not really one for P4G on Windows that really randomizes everything, just encounters.

### Credits
- Pioziomgames for a tree listing of data_e
- P4G Modding Discord (at least, that's what it still is in my heart)
- ShrineFox for the original randomizer that gave me the inspiration to make my own

## Questions you may have

### What are unstable features?
Features that might crash the game sometimes or have not been tested enough to have been added to the stable script.

### How do I use this?
See the [readme](https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/P4GPC-Randomizer#readme)

### I don't know how to run this?
Google is your friend. If you're not competent enough to do a Google search, you don't deserve to use the randomizer.
