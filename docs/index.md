### Why this ecists
Randomizers are fun, and there's not really one for P4G on Windows that really randomizes everything, just encounters.

### Credits
- Pioziomgames for a tree listing of data_e
- P4G Modding Discord (at least, that's what it still is in my heart)
- ShrineFox for the original randomizer that gave me the inspiration to make my own
