# Persona 4 Golden PC Edition Randomizer

### Why this exists
Randomizers are fun, and there's not really one for P4G on Windows that really randomizes everything, just encounters.

### Credits
- [ShrineFox](https://github.com/shrinefox) for the original randomizer that gave me the inspiration to make my own
- [Pioziomgames](https://github.com/Pioziomgames) for a tree listing of data_e
- [Furkan](https://github.com/FMudanyali) for helping with my stupid questions
- [Natano](https://github.com/natano) for giving me the "poggers" function. Seriously - look at the scripts for yourself, you'll find it
- The collective of the P4G Modding Discord (at least, that's what it still is in my heart)

## Questions you may have

### What are unstable features?
Features that might crash the game sometimes or have not been tested enough to have been added to the stable script.

### How do I use this?
1. [Set up Persona 4 Golden for modding](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13379)
2. Dump data_e into any folder you would like using [TGE's Preapp File](https://github.com/TGEnigma/preappfile/releases/latest/), preferrably one that does not require Admin access.
3. Run the [latest stable script](https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/P4GPC-Randomizer/releases/latest)
4. Run any unstable scripts that you desire (READ THE [README](https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/P4GPC-Randomizer/blob/main/Unstable%20Features/readme.md))
5. Put the dump into your mods directory
6. Run the game

### I don't know how to run this?
Google is your friend. If you're not competent enough to do a Google search, you don't deserve to use the randomizer.

### Does this work on Vita?
lol u wish sucker
